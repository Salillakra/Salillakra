# Hey there, I'm Salil Lakra! 👋

Welcome to my coding playground! 🎉

## About Me

I'm a caffeine-fueled developer from India, passionate about crafting clean code and building delightful user experiences. When I'm not glued to my screen, you can find me exploring the latest tech trends or trying to decode the mysteries of the universe (mostly debugging).

## My Stack 🛠️

- **Frontend**: React, Svelte
- **Backend**: Node.js, Django
- **Databases**: SQLite, Firebase
- **Tools**: Vite, FastAPI
- **Frameworks**: Next.js, SvelteKit
- **Other Languages**: Python, JavaScript

## Fun Facts 🤓

- I once refactored a codebase so efficiently, it achieved enlightenment and meditated for 3 days straight.
- My rubber duck debugging sessions often turn into philosophical debates.
- I believe in the power of emojis to convey complex emotions in just one character. 😉
